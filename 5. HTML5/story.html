    <h1>That time I was admitted by university.</h1>
    <main>
       <p>I took my university entrance exam in early June 2014. The exam score usually comes out in late June. And admissison is in early July. After I had taken the exam I was really nervous. I went to travel. I went to temples to prey for good result. I was in Mount Emei where many famous temple locates in a rainy day when the exam score released.</p>
       <p>As soon as, I received the report about score by cell phone I realized that I could go to the university chosen by me. I sighed with relief. The only thing I needed to worry about was when would I receive my admission letter. I had a relaxed summer vacation and my admission letter came to on time. Then I left Beijing and spent four years' time in Shanghai.</p>
